"""Test that the synthetic ground-truth data is rigid under the solver's proxy
topology.

The synthetic data in outputs/true_synthetic.npz is supposed to be generated
from the SAME skeleton the IK solver uses (the proxy MocapSkeleton). If it's
generated from the FBX rig instead, the topology differs (e.g. FBX parents
shoulders under clavicle as a sibling of neck_01; the proxy parents shoulders
under neck_01). A neck_01 bend then moves the shoulders in the proxy but NOT
in the FBX, making the data non-rigid and unfittable.

Rigidity check: in the proxy topology, the shoulder line and hip line are both
perpendicular to the spine direction in rest, and both rotate WITH the spine.
So angle(spine_dir, shoulder_line) should stay near 90° for all frames.
If the data was generated from the FBX topology (where neck_01 bend doesn't
move the shoulders), this angle blows out toward 180°.
