"""GPU provider bootstrap for ONNX Runtime on Windows.

ONNX Runtime's CUDA Execution Provider needs the CUDA + cuDNN runtime DLLs to be
loadable at process start. On Windows those aren't on the system PATH by default;
when we install them via pip (`nvidia-cuda-nvrtc-cu12`, `nvidia-cudnn-cu12`,
`nvidia-cublas-cu12`), they land under the venv's `site-packages/nvidia/*/bin`.

This module registers those directories with the Windows DLL loader *before*
onnxruntime is imported, so `CUDAExecutionProvider` shows up automatically.
We use :func:`os.add_dll_directory` (the Win32 ``AddDllDirectory`` API), which is
the reliable mechanism for Python 3.8+ — appending to ``PATH`` alone often fails
for DLLs whose dependencies are resolved at load time.

Call :func:`ensure_dlls_on_path` once at the top of any entrypoint that uses ORT.
On non-Windows or without the nvidia packages, it's a no-op.
