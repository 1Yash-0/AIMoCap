"""
Root-frame orientation via orthonormal basis alignment.

Replaces the buggy 2-vector ``Rotation.align_vectors`` in ``analytic_init``.
That call misused align_vectors on non-orthogonal input (hip-line and spine
are heavily correlated when the actor leans, dot ~ -300), so Procrustes
returned a compromise rotation fitting neither vector — 13cm neck error.

Fix: build an orthonormal frame from each side (Gram-Schmidt), then solve the
rotation between two orthonormal frames. Two orthonormal bases always have the
same inner-product structure (identity), so the Procrustes fit is exact for
the frame's defining vectors and well-conditioned.

A pure rotation can't fit data whose proportions differ from the rest skeleton
(the actor's hip-width / spine-length differ from Manny's). So we also solve a
per-frame SCALE: the desired spine length vs the rest spine length. The root
is applied as R @ (s * v), letting the spine chain stretch/compress to the
actual measurement while limbs (whose lengths are matched individually)
remain rigid.

Frame convention (right-handed, matches Manny rest):
    z-axis = spine direction  (pelvis -> neck, "up" the body)
    x-axis = hip line         (right hip - left hip, "across" the body)
    y-axis = z cross x        ("forward", "out the chest")

This module is pure numpy/scipy. Unit-testable, no Blender, no ufbx.
